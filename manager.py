        Creates a subnetwork given the actions predicted by the controller RNN,
        trains it on the provided dataset, and then returns a reward.

        Args:
            model_fn: a function which accepts one argument, a list of
                parsed actions, obtained via an inverse mapping from the
                StateSpace.
            actions: a list of parsed actions obtained via an inverse mapping
                from the StateSpace. It is in a specific order as given below:

                Consider 4 states were added to the StateSpace via the `add_state`
                method. Then the `actions` array will be of length 4, with the
                values of those states in the order that they were added.

                If number of layers is greater than one, then the `actions` array
                will be of length `4 * number of layers` (in the above scenario).
                The index from [0:4] will be for layer 0, from [4:8] for layer 1,
                etc for the number of layers.

                These action values are for direct use in the construction of models.

        Returns:
            a reward for training a model with the given actions
